3. **Run this command** once (replace YOUR_TOKEN with your actual token):
   ```bash
   ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN
   ```

**Why sign up?**
- Free tier: More tunnels, longer sessions
- Without signup: 2-hour session limit, limited requests

   ```
4. **Copy the ngrok URL** (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`)

   ```bash
   conda activate Ldjango
   python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
   ```

2. **Open your phone's browser**
3. **Paste the URL** and press Enter

---

## üåê Step 5: Share with Others

- Share the ngrok URL with anyone
- They can access your app from anywhere in the world
- The URL changes each time you restart ngrok (unless you have a paid plan)

---

## üõë How to Stop

- **Press Ctrl+C** in the ngrok terminal to stop ngrok
- **Close** the Django terminal to stop Django
- **OR** just close both terminal windows

---

## üí° Tips & Tricks

### **Keep the Same URL (Paid Feature)**
Ngrok paid plans offer reserved domains that don't change.
- **Basic Plan**: $8/month
- **Get it**: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/billing

### **Ngrok Alternative Commands**

**Custom subdomain** (requires paid plan):
```bash
ngrok http 8000 --subdomain=mytenantapp
```

**View requests in browser**:
Visit http://localhost:4040 while ngrok is running to see all HTTP requests!

### **Security Notes**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**:
- Your app is publicly accessible while ngrok is running
- Anyone with the URL can access it
- Use strong passwords for your admin account
- Don't leave it running unattended with sensitive data

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### **"ngrok is not recognized as a command"**
- Make sure `ngrok.exe` is in your project folder
- OR add ngrok to your PATH (see Step 1)

### **"Failed to listen on port 8000"**
- Another program is using port 8000
- Find and close it, or use a different port:
  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver 8001
  ngrok http 8001
  ```

### **"Invalid Host header"**
- This is already fixed in your Django settings!
- If you still see it, make sure DEBUG=True in your .env file

### **Ngrok shows "Session Expired"**
- Free tier has 2-hour sessions
- Sign up and add your auth token (see Step 2)
- OR just restart ngrok

### **Connection is slow**
- Ngrok adds some latency (100-300ms)
- This is normal for tunnel services
- For production, use proper hosting instead

## üöÄ Next Steps

Once you're satisfied with testing:

1. **For permanent hosting**: Consider Raspberry Pi or VPS
2. **Buy a domain**: Link it to your hosting
3. **Set up SSL**: Use Let's Encrypt (free)
4. **Harden security**: Disable DEBUG, use strong passwords
