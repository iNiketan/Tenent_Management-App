# Building Details Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive Building Details page for your Tenant Management Django application with all requested features.

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Building Details Page (`/building/<id>/`)

**Two View Modes:**
- **All Rooms Grid** (Default): Responsive grid showing all rooms across all floors
- **Floors Table View** (Toggle): Collapsible tables organized by floor with lazy loading

**Each Room Card Shows:**
- Room number and floor
- Status badge (OK/Due Soon/Overdue/Vacant/Maintenance) with color coding
- Room status pill (Occupied/Vacant/Maintenance)
- Tenant name and monthly rent (if active lease)
- Last bill period, status, and electricity units

### 2. Interactive Room Details Drawer

**Opens when clicking any room card. Contains:**

**A. Room Status Controls**
- Quick toggle buttons: Occupied / Vacant / Maintenance
- Updates in real-time via HTMX

**B. Active Lease Information**
- Tenant name, phone, rent, start/end dates, deposit

**C. Recent Bills List (Last 6)**
- Period, amount, status, due date
- Quick action buttons on each bill:
  - **Mark Paid**: Creates payment record
  - **Mark Unpaid**: Removes payment record  
  - **Mark Partial**: Creates partial payment

**D. Create New Bill Form**
- Period (YYYY-MM)
- Rent amount (pre-filled)
- Optional electricity units and amount
- Creates Invoice and InvoiceItem records

### 3. Badge Status Logic

The system automatically calculates badge status:
- 🟢 **OK**: Bill paid or no issues
- 🟠 **Due Soon**: Due within 3 days
- 🔴 **Overdue**: Past due date
- ⚪ **Vacant**: No active lease
- 🟡 **Maintenance**: Room under maintenance

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 3. Seed Demo Data (Optional)

```bash
python manage.py seed_demo
```

### 4. Start the Server

```bash

```

### 5. Navigate to the Feature

1. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## 📊 Data Flow

Check Active Lease → Get Recent Invoices → Check Payment Status → 
Calculate Due Dates → Determine Badge Status → Extract Electricity Data
```

### Bill Status Management
```
Paid: Create RentPayment record
Unpaid: Delete RentPayment records
Partial: Create RentPayment with 50% amount
```

### Invoice Creation
```
Validate Period → Check Existing Invoice → Create Invoice → 
Create InvoiceItems (Rent + Electricity) → Store Metadata → Refresh Panel
```

## 🔐 Security

- ✅ All views require `@login_required`
- ✅ CSRF protection on all POST requests
- ✅ Input validation for status values
- ✅ Method restrictions (GET/POST)

## ⚡ Performance

- ✅ Efficient database queries with `select_related()`
- ✅ Lazy loading for floor tables (HTMX)
- ✅ Partial updates (no full page reloads)
- ✅ Minimal JavaScript footprint

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

## 📝 Notes

1. **No Schema Changes**: The implementation uses existing models (Invoice/InvoiceItem instead of Bill/PaymentNote as mentioned in requirements)
2. **Invoice = Bill**: The terms are used interchangeably in the codebase
3. **Due Date Logic**: Calculated as 5 days after the first of the month (configurable in `get_room_finance_snapshot()`)
4. **Partial Payments**: Simplified to 50% of invoice amount (can be customized)

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: python-dateutil not installed
**Solution**: Run `pip install python-dateutil==2.8.2` in your conda environment

### Issue: Drawer doesn't open
**Solution**: Check browser console, ensure Alpine.js and HTMX are loaded

### Issue: Bills not updating
**Solution**: Verify CSRF token, check network tab for errors
