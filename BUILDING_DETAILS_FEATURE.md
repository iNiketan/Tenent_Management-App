### Seeded Data Testing

```bash

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

2. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter rooms by status, tenant, payment status
3. **Export Features**: Export room/billing data to CSV/PDF
4. **Payment History**: Detailed payment history with receipts
5. **Notifications**: Alert for overdue bills
6. **Custom Due Dates**: Per-lease due date configuration
7. **Recurring Bills**: Auto-generate monthly bills
8. **Analytics Dashboard**: Building-level financial analytics

## Troubleshooting

### Drawer Doesn't Open
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify Alpine.js is loaded
- Check HTMX version compatibility

### Bills Not Updating
- Verify CSRF token is included in forms
- Check network tab for failed requests
- Ensure proper HTMX attributes

### Status Badge Incorrect
- Verify invoice dates are correct
- Check RentPayment records exist
- Review `get_room_finance_snapshot` logic

### Floor Table Not Loading
- Check HTMX `hx-trigger="intersect once"` works
- Verify URL patterns match
- Check for template errors in console

## Performance Considerations

- **Database Queries**: Uses `select_related()` for efficient queries
- **Lazy Loading**: Floor tables load on-demand via HTMX
- **Caching**: Consider adding caching for building snapshots
- **Pagination**: For buildings with many rooms, consider pagination

## Security

- All views require `@login_required` decorator
- CSRF protection on all POST requests
- Input validation for status values and dates
- GET/POST method restrictions with `@require_http_methods`

## Accessibility

- Minimum 44px touch targets
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and compatible with:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

Requires:
- JavaScript enabled
- Modern CSS support (Flexbox, Grid)
- HTMX 1.9.10
- Alpine.js 3.x
