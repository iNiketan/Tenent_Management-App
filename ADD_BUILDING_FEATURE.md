- With prefix "A": `A101, A102, ... A201, A202`

## ✨ Features

### Automatic Room Number Generation
- **Pattern**: `{prefix}{floor_number}{room_number:02d}`
- **Examples**:
  - Floor 0, Room 1 → `001`
  - Floor 1, Room 5 → `105`
  - Floor 2, Room 10 → `210`
  - With prefix "A": Floor 1, Room 3 → `A103`

### Transaction Safety
- If anything fails during creation, **nothing** is created
- Database stays consistent
- No partial buildings or orphaned rooms

### Validation
- ✅ Building name must be unique
- ✅ Floors: 1-50
- ✅ Rooms per floor: 1-100
- ✅ Prevents duplicate building names (case-insensitive)

### User Experience
- 📱 Mobile-responsive (works on phone/tablet)
- 🌙 Dark mode support
- ⚡ Live preview of what will be created
- 💬 Clear error messages
- 💡 Helpful tips and examples

## 📝 Future Enhancements (Ideas)

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Bulk room editing** - Edit multiple rooms at once
2. **Custom floor names** - Name floors instead of numbers (G, 1, 2, Mezzanine)
3. **Import from CSV** - Upload building data from spreadsheet
4. **Room templates** - Save room configurations for reuse
5. **Building cloning** - Duplicate existing building structure
6. **Floor plan upload** - Attach floor plan images
7. **Room types** - Categorize rooms (1BHK, 2BHK, Studio)

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I edit rooms after creation?**  
A: Yes! You can edit individual rooms from the building details page.

**Q: What if I make a mistake in the form?**  
A: No worries! If validation fails, nothing is created. Fix the errors and resubmit.

**Q: Can I have different rooms per floor?**  
A: Currently, all floors get the same number of rooms. You can add/remove rooms manually after creation.

**Q: What happens to room numbers if I delete a floor?**  
A: Room numbers don't change. You'd need to manually update them if desired.

**Q: Can I use letters for floor numbers?**  
A: Currently floors use numbers (0, 1, 2...). You can customize room prefixes though.

**Q: Is there a limit on building size?**  
A: Yes, max 50 floors and 100 rooms per floor (5,000 total rooms per building).
