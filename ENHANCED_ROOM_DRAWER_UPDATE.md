## ⚡ Key Features

### 1. Auto-Bill Creation
When you open the drawer for any room with an active lease, the system automatically creates a bill for the current month if it doesn't exist. This ensures you always have a current month bill to manage.

### 2. One-Click Payment Status
Three large buttons let you instantly mark rent as:
- **Paid** (green) - Creates full payment record
- **Partial** (orange) - Lets you specify amount paid
- **Unpaid** (red) - Removes payment records

### 3. Real-Time Meter Tracking
Enter meter readings as you take them. The system automatically:
- Tracks latest and previous readings
- Calculates units used
- Displays reading dates
- Allows updating or adding new readings

### 4. Inline Everything
No need to navigate to different pages. Update:
- Tenant assignment
- Rent amount
- Payment status
- Meter readings

All from one convenient drawer!

## 🎯 Usage Tips

### Daily Operations
1. **Morning routine**: Open each occupied room's drawer, check meter readings
2. **Rent collection**: Click room → Set status to Paid/Partial
3. **Tenant changes**: Click room → Select new tenant → Update
4. **Rent adjustments**: Click room → Change amount → Update

### Quick Actions
- **Paid rent?** → Click room → Click green "Paid" button → Done!
- **New reading?** → Click room → Enter value → Save → Done!
- **Rent increase?** → Click room → Update rent field → Update → Done!

## 🔐 Security

- ✅ All endpoints require `@login_required`
- ✅ CSRF protection on all forms
- ✅ POST method required for all updates
- ✅ Input validation on all fields
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages

## 📱 Responsive Design

- **Mobile** (320px+): Full-width drawer, stacked buttons
- **Tablet** (768px+): Medium drawer, flexible layouts
- **Desktop** (1024px+): Fixed-width drawer, optimal spacing

## 🚀 Performance

- Efficient database queries with `select_related()`
- Lazy loading of meter readings (only latest 2)
- HTMX partial updates (no full page reloads)
- Auto-creation happens once per month per room

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Batch Updates**: Open multiple room drawers in separate tabs/windows for quick batch updates
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Use Tab to move between fields quickly
3. **Default Values**: Rent field pre-fills with current rent, date picker defaults to today
4. **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded sections help you find information quickly
5. **Smart Defaults**: Current month bill auto-creates when needed

## 🎉 Success!

Your tenant management system now has a powerful, intuitive, all-in-one room maintenance interface. Everything you need to manage tenants, rent, and electricity is accessible from one convenient drawer - no page navigation required!

## 📝 Notes

- The system uses the existing `Invoice` model (not a separate `Bill` model)
- Payment status is determined by the presence/amount of `RentPayment` records
- Meter readings are stored in the `MeterReading` model
- All updates return the refreshed drawer content via HTMX
- Messages appear at the bottom of the drawer after each action

## 🛠️ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

If you want to extend this further, consider:
1. Bulk meter reading entry (all rooms at once)
2. SMS notifications when rent is marked paid
3. Auto-calculate electricity charges based on units
4. Export monthly report for all rooms
5. Recurring rent payment reminders
6. WhatsApp integration for tenant communication
